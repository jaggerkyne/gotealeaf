# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby.
# And explain what would happen in the following scenarios: 

# 1. what is != and where should you use it?
# != means 'not equal', use when comparing two values

# 2. put ! before something, like !user_name
# means opposite of something

# 3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# means mutate the caller, or it depends on the method implementation

# 4. put ? before something
# ?: is the ternary operator for if...else

# 5. put ? after something
#means returning value is a boolean value

# 6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
# !!<some object> turn any object into their boolean equvalent.
